									<h2>Background</h2>
									<p>I was born in Chongqing, China, one of the youngest cities in the country. My life has always been shaped by urban landscapes mixed with a blend of old-town charm. Chongqing is a vibrant city, surrounded by three major rivers, where people enjoy hotpot and spicy food as part of their daily life. Many aspects of this, along with my family's background in healthcare, have fueled my passion for healthcare, biology, and technology.</p>

									<h3>My Journey</h3>
									<button type="button" class="collapsible">1996-2005 Chongqing, China</button>
									<div id="collapsiblecontent">
									  <p class = "indent">This is where I have the most vivid memories of my childhood. I attended Shuren Primary School. Although most of my childhood friends are now far out of reach, both in time and distance, I can still recall the joy of shopping for fun stationery and competing with Pokémon cards.</p>
									</div>
									<button type="button" class="collapsible">2006-2007 Baltimore, US</button>
									<div id="collapsiblecontent">
									  <p class = "indent">I spent some time living in the U.S. while my parent was a visiting scholar at Johns Hopkins University. We lived in a small apartment, and I attended Rodgers Forge Elementary. Initially, I struggled with learning English, but I picked it up quickly. This period remains the most special part of my journey. I still remember my friends, even though we've long since lost contact.</p>
									</div>
									<button type="button" class="collapsible">2008-2014 Chongqing, China</button>
									<div id="collapsiblecontent">
										<p class="indent">When my visa expired, I returned to my hometown. I worked hard to improve my Chinese and math skills. When I first came back, I could barely write in Chinese, but by the end of my first year, I had earned the highest score in Chinese in my class. Math was a bit tricky, but I excelled in that as well. What was particularly interesting was English. I hadn’t realized how many grammatical rules there were in speaking. I had always assumed it would come naturally.</p>
										<p class="indent">During this time, I also attended middle school and high school. My teachers were very strict. I would say I coasted through most of middle school, doing the bare minimum (which was still a lot). However, I still remember my math and chemistry teachers. In high school, I was in a class led by a chemistry teacher. In my second year, I decided to go abroad and transferred to an international class. My parents were very supportive, but I knew it took a lot from them—money, energy, and concern. Regardless, I began to understand the difference between a top-tier high school (where I had been) and an average one. I could easily be the top of my class there, but I also realized I wasn’t good enough—it was the environment that made the difference.</p>
										<p class="indent">I still tried my best. I started to get away from the coasting mindset. It began the summer break before I would officially attend the international class. I was gaming day and night, and one single moment I realized I could not live my life like this. And I changed. I started to be a studious person. I tried very hard in the new class. I understand if I let my life go coast I would go nowhere with just my parents' support. And so I tried. I got almost excellent scores in TOFEL (an English ability exam) and SAT and made the <a href = "https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%AF%9B%E4%B9%90%E7%84%B6/12622997?fr=ge_ala">news.</a></p>
										<p class="indent">When I graduated, I remember the residence assistant telling me that I was too timid and needed to take more initiative in life. Later on, I heard that the reputation of the international class declined, and it may no longer exist. Still, I hope the people I met there are doing well.</p>

									<button type="button" class="collapsible">2014-2018 Virginia, US</button>
									<div id="collapsiblecontent">
										<p class="indent">I started attending university in University of Virginia. I'll be honest I was a bit disappointed at first. Because I thought with my grades I could go to a top school. But that didn't happen, as it shouldn't. Grades are not the only thing that matters, I hope I could realize it earlier.</p>
										<p class="indent">Like in high school, I used most of my energy to study. And I didn't go anywhere in terms of grades. I was considered smart and hardworking but that's about it. In my second year I met a friend in the intro to CS class. I liked her a lot and we went out to a lot of events together, or just hanged around the grounds. It was much fun.</p>
										<p class="indent">Ironically, I did not start research until way later. I just joined a lab in the summer before my senior years and I tried very hard to make up for my lack of experience. My work was mostly on the computer. However my work led to a talk at a specialized symposium and earned me a summer research award.</p>
										<p class="indent">I left college with a lot of regrets. Ones that help me grow because I know I don't want to be there any more.</p>
